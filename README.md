## About

Migrated from WordPress to GitHub Pages using [jsanz's guide](README-original.md) as reference. Built with Jekyll and the Minima theme.

LLMs (ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot Claude Opus 4.5 (preview)) have been helpful for troubleshooting, writing posts, and maintaining this blog.

## Lessons Learned

- GitHub repos have a **Pages** section where you can change the reference branch for deployment
- Dependabot's `remediate` option runs a workflow and creates a PR with fixes — useful for staying on top of vulnerabilities
- When troubleshooting `Gemfile.lock` issues, sometimes deleting and running `bundle install` fresh helps, but sticking with `gem 'github-pages'` keeps things GitHub Pages compatible
