<p>I've just learned that the usr directory on Linux/UNIX systems stands for UNIX System Resouces. I always assuments that the usr was an abbreviation for user. So another lesson is (or a refresher) is that never assume.</p>

<p>Seconds thing learned is that there are two indipendent /tmp in Linux. One is /tmp and other is in /var/tmp. Important thing that I didn'k know before was that the content of /tmp is deleted automatically. A file in /tmp will be removed automatically after ten days and the file in /var/tmp will be removed after thirty days.</p>

<p>All learned thanks to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Technical Overview course - lesson The File System Hierarchy. Thanks to Red Hat who made the material available for free (temporary) at https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/rh024-red-hat-linux-technical-overview.</p>
