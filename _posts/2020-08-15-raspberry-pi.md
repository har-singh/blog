Setting up an Apache Web Server on a Raspberry Pi

Here are some useful resources I found while setting up my Raspberry Pi as a web server:

- Official Raspberry Pi Documentation - [raspberrypi.org](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/web-server/apache.md)
- Tom's Hardware Guide - [tomshardware.com](https://www.tomshardware.com/uk/news/raspberry-pi-web-server,40174.html)
- Pi My Life Up Tutorial - [pimylifeup.com](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-web-server/)
- DigiKey Guide - [digikey.com](https://www.digikey.com/en/maker/blogs/2020/how-to-use-raspberry-pi-as-a-web-server)
- ReadWrite Hosting Guide - [readwrite.com](https://readwrite.com/2014/06/27/raspberry-pi-web-server-website-hosting/)

## Hardware Purchase

Purchased and paid for a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (8GB RAM) at 11:25. Ready to start setting up!
