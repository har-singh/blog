High-throughput Ethernet ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) are a critical component of modern high-speed networking. In this post, I summarize key insights from Justin Pietsch's article, "A Summary of High-Speed Ethernet ASICs," and share some additional notes.

### Key Takeaways from the Article

- **Chip Reticle Limit**: The absolute maximum size is 33x26 mm (858mm²). Nvidia's next-gen chip, GA100, boasts 54.2 billion transistors and a die size of 826mm² using a 7nm processor node.
- **Comparison to Raspberry Pi**: For perspective, my Raspberry Pi’s chip is just 10x10 mm.
- **ASICs vs GPUs**: Network ASICs are now as large as GPUs, indicating the increasing complexity of networking hardware.
- **Integrated Circuits (ICs)**: In this context, IP refers to "Intellectual Property."
- **Programmable Pipeline**: The author argues that a programmable pipeline, especially for OpenFlow, may not be necessary.
- **Vendor Considerations**: The author expresses caution in using Cisco, as they lack experience in this area. However, there's confidence in the Dune/Leaba team.

### Key Quote to Remember

> "As networks get large, the cost of the network is driven by the cost of the optics. The real money saving is not when you get a faster chip, but when the chip supports higher throughput SERDES."
