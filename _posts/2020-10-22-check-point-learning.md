- **Stateful Inspection** — Tracks the state of network connections to make more intelligent filtering decisions (patented by Check Point)
- **Application Intelligence** — Deep packet inspection at the application layer to identify and control specific applications
- **INSPECT Engine** — Check Point's proprietary inspection engine that processes traffic through the firewall
- **Security Gateway** — The firewall component that enforces security policy and inspects traffic
- **Management Server** — Centralised server for managing security policies across multiple gateways
- **SmartDashboard / SmartConsole** — GUI tools for configuring and managing Check Point firewalls
