A quick reference for the two common number formats in Excel for financial data.

## Currency Format

- Shows numbers with a currency symbol (e.g. £, €, $) and 2 decimal places
- Symbol appears right next to the number
- Negative numbers can show in brackets or with a minus

Example: `£1,234.56`

## Accounting Format

- Aligns currency symbols and decimal points in a column
- Currency symbol sits at the left edge of the cell
- Zero values show as a dash

Example: `£     1,234.56` (symbol left-aligned)

## When to Use Which

- Use **Currency** for inline financial values
- Use **Accounting** for tidy columns in financial statements
