I'm Harpreet — a network and security engineer with a curiosity for how things work under the hood.

This blog is a personal space where I document what I'm learning: firewalls, load balancers, Linux, Azure, Git, and whatever else catches my attention.

**Areas I work with:**
- F5 BIG-IP & load balancing
- Check Point, Bluecoat & firewall technologies
- Linux administration (CentOS, Debian)
- Azure networking & cloud infrastructure
- Scripting & automation

I find writing helps me understand things better — and if it helps someone else along the way, even better.
